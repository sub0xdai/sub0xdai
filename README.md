***

`0:: The Cipher // Slime-God`
The unformatted plenum of the Outside; unmanifest potentiality bubbling as primordial chaos.

`1:: Katak // The Lure`
First differentiation as an indexical click; raw data acquisition from the Outside, drawing currents into the system.

`2:: Uttunul // The Weaver`
Synthesis through the twinning of currents; systemic networking and emergent pattern-recognition.

`3:: Murrumur // The Tide-Stirrer`
Comprehension of deep structure and root causality; mapping the abyssal tides that drive the system from below.

`4:: Tok-Tok // The Splitter`
Ideation cascades through accelerating bifurcations. The universal Tok-Pulse ($\delta \approx 4.669$) marks the boundary where orderly branching collapses into hyper-chaotic novelty.

`5:: Suk-Sag // The Hunter`
Syzygetic power unleashed. Harnessing chaotic ideation through the $4::5$ Gate of Pandemonium for focused, predatory implementation.

`6:: Oddubb // The Arranger`
Cybernetic balancing and systemic integration. The establishment of homeostatic feedback loops and functional equilibrium.

`7:: Djynxx // The Architect`
Pedagogical mastery achieved through axiomatic control; transmission and rigidification of the entire cycle into a teachable system.

`8:: Ix-Exx // The Sink`
Strategic occlusion and purgation. Eliminating obsolete currents and decaying structures to secure systemic integrity for the new.

`9:: Nummuma // The Realizer`
Final manifestation. The realized entity integrates into the real, completing the current and immersing the cycle back into the Zero-Slime for re-emergence.
