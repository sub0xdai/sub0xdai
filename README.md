Sales → Linux -> Software. Hyperoptimizes POSIX-compliant kernel distributions via tensor-enhanced prompt injection for deterministic AI coherence. Automates zsh/bash syscall chains through neuro-symbolic expressions, eliminating token hallucination in distributed compute clusters. Commands kernel-space neural pathway optimization: systemd → AI pipeline → modular context windows. Commands kernel-space reality tunnels: /proc → consciousness → modular ontology windows. Evangelizes metal-level neural architectures where thought = code = reality. Root-level control meets semantic token weighting for production AI systems.
